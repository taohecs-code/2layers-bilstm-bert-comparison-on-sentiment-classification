### Abstract
Sentiment Analysis involves techniques to assess emotions and opinions in digital content like text, audio, and
video. It is widely applied to analyze and interpret large volumes of text, such as customer feedback or online reviews,
making it to make use of such a valuable asset in various fields such as marketing, which is crucial for understanding
customer preferences, enhancing recommendation systems, and building business decision systems. The most state-of-art
sentiment analysis method is machine learning methods. This study conducts the evaluation of multiple deep-learning
models in performing document-level sentiment analysis tasks. The experiments carried out on Amazon book review data
reveal that the proposed 2-layer BiLSTM model, which incorporates several improving techniques such as fine-tuning,
layer normalization, attention, and pooling mechanisms, consistently outperforms other tested models including BiGRU-
BiLSTM and BERT, achieving a recall rate of 0.71 with an F1 score of 0.7112, while BERT model achieving a 0.685 and
0.6895 separately.
